A test for October CMS to see if Apache is setup correctly

Some sample code to help with this issue I raised with October CMS:

<https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/5116>

It tries to check if Apache allows .htaccess files and whether mod_rewrite is enabled.

It isn't perfect, the code is scruffy, and **THERE IS NO SECURITY IN IT**, but it works in my tests. Hopefully it will help improve their installer.
